## Technical Discoveries

### Module Name Conflicts
- Files cannot be named after framework modules
- `lists.swift` ‚Üí `list-examples.swift` 
- `media.swift` ‚Üí `media-elements.swift`
- This is due to all code being compiled into the Swiftlets module namespace

### Missing Elements
- **Not Implemented**: Br, S, Wbr, ColGroup, Col, OptGroup
- These elements need to be added to the framework

### Build System Insights
- Makefile performs sed transformation: `'s/let request = try/let _ = try/'`
- All source files are compiled together with `-module-name Swiftlets`
- Components.swift is automatically included in all builds

2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Updated showcase progress and known issues
3. **STATUS.md** - Enhanced examples section, corrected media status
