# Swiftlets Framework Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Swiftlets aims to revolutionize server-side Swift development by bringing the familiar SwiftUI declarative syntax to web applications. Our unique executable-per-route architecture provides unparalleled isolation, security, and flexibility while maintaining excellent performance.

## Core Principles

1. **Developer Experience First** - SwiftUI-like syntax that Swift developers already know
2. **Type Safety** - Compile-time guarantees for HTML generation and routing
3. **Performance** - Sub-millisecond response times through efficient architecture
4. **Flexibility** - Mix languages, update routes without restarts, progressive adoption
5. **Production Ready** - Built for real-world applications from day one

## Development Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

The core architecture and basic functionality have been implemented:

- **HTTP Server**: SwiftNIO-based server with HTTP/1.1 support
- **Executable Architecture**: Each route runs as an isolated process
- **Request/Response Model**: JSON-based communication between server and swiftlets
- **Basic Routing**: Simple path-based routing system
- **Multi-platform Support**: Structure for macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon) and Linux

### âœ… Phase 2: HTML DSL (Complete)

A comprehensive HTML generation library with SwiftUI-like syntax:

- **Result Builders**: `@HTMLBuilder` for declarative HTML composition
- **60+ HTML Elements**: Complete HTML5 coverage with type safety
- **Layout System**: HStack, VStack, ZStack, Grid, Container, Spacer
- **Modifiers**: Chainable modifiers for styles, classes, attributes
- **Dynamic Helpers**: ForEach, If, Fragment for dynamic content
- **100% Test Coverage**: All components thoroughly tested

### ðŸš€ Phase 3: Developer Experience (Q1 2025)

Making Swiftlets a joy to use for developers.

#### 3.1 Automatic Compilation System
- **Auto-compile on Request**: Compile swiftlets from source on first access
- **File Watching**: Automatic recompilation when source files change
- **Compilation Cache**: Store compiled binaries with dependency tracking
- **Error Reporting**: Clear error messages with source file locations and suggestions

#### 3.2 Command Line Interface
```bash
# Project management
swiftlets new my-app           # Create new project
swiftlets generate route /users # Generate route scaffold
swiftlets generate model User   # Generate data model

# Development
swiftlets serve               # Start dev server with hot reload
swiftlets test               # Run tests
