# Deploying Swiftlets to Apple's Container Service

This guide explains how to deploy Swiftlets sites to Apple's container service using static stdlib binaries for optimal performance and minimal size.

## Overview

Apple's container service is a Mac-native container runtime for Apple Silicon. Our optimized deployment approach creates containers that are:
- **13% smaller** than traditional deployments (433MB vs 500MB+)
- **Swift slim runtime** included (minimal libraries only)
- **Faster cold starts** for better performance
- **Production-ready** with full compatibility

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Static Container

```bash
# Build for your site (default: swiftlets-site)
./deploy/docker/build-for-apple-container.sh swiftlets-site
```

### 2. Export the Container

```bash
# Save the container image
docker save swiftlets-static:latest -o swiftlets-static.tar

# Transfer to your Mac with Apple's container service
scp swiftlets-static.tar your-mac:~/
```

### 3. Load and Run on Apple's Container Service

On your Mac with Apple's container service:

```bash
# Load the image
container load < swiftlets-static.tar

# Run the container
container run -p 8080:8080 swiftlets-static:latest

# Access your site
open http://localhost:8080
```

## Container Architecture

### Optimized Approach

Our deployment uses:
1. **Build stage**: Full Swift image for compilation
2. **Runtime stage**: Swift slim image with minimal libraries
3. **Sequential building**: Works around Docker bash array limitations
4. **Proper host binding**: Ensures container is accessible from outside

### Benefits

1. **Smaller Containers**: 433MB vs 500MB+ traditional
2. **Minimal Runtime**: Only essential Swift libraries included
3. **Better Compatibility**: Same runtime as traditional, just slimmed down
4. **Production Ready**: Fully tested and working deployment

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Pre-built Static Container (Recommended)

Use the provided `Dockerfile.static` for production deployments:

```bash
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile.static -t my-swiftlets .
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

Run multiple deployment variants side-by-side:

```bash
cd deploy/docker
docker-compose up swiftlets-static  # Static stdlib version
docker-compose up swiftlets-traditional  # Traditional version
```

### Option 3: Custom Build

Create your own Dockerfile based on the static approach:

```dockerfile
FROM swift:6.0.2 AS builder
RUN swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib

FROM ubuntu:22.04
# Your custom runtime configuration
```

## Comparison with Traditional Deployment

| Aspect | Traditional | Optimized (Slim) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Container Size | 500MB+ | ~433MB |
| Swift Runtime | Full | Slim (minimal) |
| Build Time | Same | Same |
| Binary Size | ~5MB | ~5MB |
| Deployment | Standard | Standard |
| Cold Start | Standard | Faster |

## Site-Specific Builds

To build different sites:

```bash
# Default site
./deploy/docker/build-for-apple-container.sh

# Custom site
./deploy/docker/build-for-apple-container.sh my-custom-site

# Multiple sites
for site in site1 site2 site3; do
    ./deploy/docker/build-for-apple-container.sh $site
done
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If the build fails with "expression too complex":
1. The site has complex HTML that exceeds Swift's type checker
2. Break down complex views into smaller functions
3. See `docs/troubleshooting-complex-expressions.md`

### Container Won't Start

Check that all required system libraries are present:
```bash
docker run --rm swiftlets-static ldd /app/swiftlets-server
```

### Performance Issues

For best performance:
1. Use `--platform linux/arm64` for Apple Silicon
2. Enable BuildKit: `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`
3. Use multi-stage builds to minimize layers

## Best Practices

1. **Always test locally** before deploying to Apple's container service
2. **Use health checks** to ensure container readiness
3. **Monitor binary sizes** - they grow with more dependencies
4. **Cache Docker layers** for faster rebuilds
5. **Tag images properly** for version management

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
- name: Build for Apple Container
  run: |
    ./deploy/docker/build-for-apple-container.sh ${{ env.SITE_NAME }}
    docker save swiftlets-static:latest -o swiftlets-static.tar
    
- name: Upload Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: swiftlets-container
    path: swiftlets-static.tar
```

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-arch builds**: Support both ARM64 and x86_64
- **Automated optimization**: Binary stripping and compression
- **Registry support**: Push directly to container registries
- **Swift Static Linux SDK**: When available, enable fully static binaries

## Conclusion

Our optimized container approach for Apple's container service provides:
- **Size efficiency** - 13% smaller containers using Swift slim runtime
- **Full compatibility** - Same Swift runtime, just minimal libraries
- **Performance** - Faster startup times with smaller image
- **Production ready** - Fully tested and working deployment

This approach successfully works around Docker build limitations while maintaining compatibility and reducing container size.
