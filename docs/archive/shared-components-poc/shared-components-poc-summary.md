# Shared Components POC Summary

## What We Learned

### 1. Module System Concept Works
Swift's module system can provide the interface/type information separately from the implementation:
- `.swiftmodule` = Interface (like header files)
- Source files or libraries = Implementation

### 2. Current Challenges

#### Circular Dependencies
- `ResponseBuilder.swift` depends on `HTMLElement`
- Must compile files in correct order
- Wildcards (`**/*.swift`) don't guarantee order

#### Import Limitations
- Can't use `import Swiftlets` within site files when compiling together
- Must compile as one unit with all sources

### 3. Viable Approaches

#### A. Source Inclusion (Simple, Works Today)
```bash
swiftc \
    Sources/Swiftlets/HTML/**/*.swift \
    Sources/Swiftlets/Core/*.swift \
    sites/my-site/shared/*.swift \
    sites/my-site/src/index.swift \
    -o sites/my-site/bin/index
```
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ No modules needed
- ❌ Recompiles everything

#### B. Pre-compiled Swiftlets + Source Sharing
```bash
# Build Swiftlets as library once
swiftc -emit-library Sources/Swiftlets/**/*.swift -o libSwiftlets.a

# Build each page with shared sources
swiftc \
    -L . -lSwiftlets \
    sites/my-site/shared/*.swift \
    sites/my-site/src/index.swift \
    -o sites/my-site/bin/index
```
- ✅ Swiftlets compiled once
- ✅ Shared components included
- ❌ Still recompiles shared components

#### C. Swift Package Manager (Recommended)
Use SPM for Swiftlets and SharedComponents:
```
sites/my-site/
├── Package.swift           # Defines SharedComponents library
├── Sources/
│   └── SharedComponents/
│       └── Navigation.swift
└── src/                   # Individual pages
    └── index.swift
```

- ✅ Professional tooling
- ✅ Handles dependencies
- ✅ IDE support
- ✅ Can produce static library

## Recommendation

For immediate implementation:
1. **Keep it simple**: Use source inclusion (Option A)
2. **Document the pattern**: Show users how to organize shared files
3. **Plan for SPM**: Design with future SPM integration in mind

For future enhancement:
1. **Adopt SPM for shared components** (Option C)
2. **Keep swiftlets as simple files** (not packages)
3. **Maintain file-based routing**

## Next Steps

1. Update `build-site` to support a `shared/` directory
2. Create example site with shared components
3. Document the pattern in user guide
4. Plan SPM integration for v2
