# Note on Apple Container Files

The following files were archived because they contain misconceptions about a non-existent "Apple container service":

- `deployment-apple-container.md`
- `apple-container-static-poc.md`
- `apple-container-poc-summary.md`

## Important Context

These documents were written under the mistaken impression that Apple provides a container deployment service similar to AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run. **This is incorrect** - Apple does not offer any such container hosting service.

The work documented in these files was actually standard Docker optimization techniques for:
- Multi-stage builds
- Static binary compilation
- Container size reduction
- Cross-platform compatibility

While the technical content about Docker optimization remains valid, the framing around "Apple's container service" is entirely fictional and should be disregarded.
