# Documentation Updates Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the documentation updates made to correct references to the non-existent "Apple's Swift Container Plugin" and ensure all deployment documentation accurately reflects the actual Docker-based deployment approach.

## Documents Updated

### 1. `/docs/deployment-overview.md`
**Changes:**
- Removed references to "Apple's Swift Container Plugin"
- Updated to focus on Docker-based deployment approaches
- Corrected quick start commands to use actual deployment scripts
- Fixed GitHub URL from `yourusername` to `codelynx`

### 2. `/docs/container-deployment.md`
**Changes:**
- Complete rewrite of the document
- Removed all Swift Container Plugin references
- Focused entirely on Docker deployment
- Added comprehensive Docker deployment guide including:
  - Docker Compose examples
  - Kubernetes deployment
  - AWS ECS task definitions
  - CI/CD integration examples
  - Production best practices
  - Troubleshooting guide

### 3. `/docs/README.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated deployment section description
- Changed "Using Swift Container Plugin and Docker" to "Production deployment with Docker"

### 4. `/deploy/README.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated container deployment section
- Removed Swift Container Plugin references
- Added Docker-specific deployment instructions
- Updated paths to actual deployment scripts

### 5. `/docs/alice-story-getting-started.md`
**Previously Updated:**
- Fixed GitHub URLs from `yourusername` to `codelynx`
- Added Chapter 9 about Docker deployment
- Updated deployment instructions to use Docker

## Key Corrections

1. **Swift Container Plugin**: This was a misconception. There is no official Apple Swift Container Plugin. All references have been removed or corrected.

2. **Docker Deployment**: The actual deployment method uses:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Swift slim runtime images (433MB)
   - Platform-specific builds (ARM64/AMD64)
   - The `deploy/docker/build-optimized-container.sh` script

3. **Deployment Scripts**: Corrected paths and commands:
   - Old: `./deploy/container/build-container.sh`
   - New: `./deploy/docker/build-optimized-container.sh`

## Remaining Work

All deployment-related documentation has been reviewed and updated. The deployment documentation now accurately reflects:
- Docker as the primary container deployment method
- Correct script locations and usage
- Actual deployment workflows used in production
- Proper GitHub repository URLs

## Production Deployment Status

The Swiftlets site is currently deployed at:
- **URL**: http://swiftlet.eastlynx.com:8080/
- **Method**: Docker container on AWS EC2
- **Platform**: ARM64 (t4g.small)
- **Container**: Swift 6.0.2 slim runtime

All documentation now correctly reflects this deployment approach.
