Restructure project: Separate core testing from user examples

Major reorganization to improve project structure and developer experience:

Structure Changes:
- Create core/sites/ for internal framework testing
- Create sdk/sites/ for user-facing examples
- Add test sites: test-routing, test-html, benchmark
- Move showcase to sdk/sites/swiftlets-site

Core Test Sites:
- test-routing: Tests path parsing and query parameters
- test-html: Tests HTML DSL features and escaping
- benchmark: Performance testing with large datasets

Build System:
- Add build-test-sites.sh for building core test sites
- Remove 9 obsolete/broken build scripts
- Keep only working, essential scripts

Documentation:
- Add project-structure-v2.md with new organization
- Add structure-migration-guide.md for migration steps
- Update README.md with new structure
- Update CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_STATUS.md

Benefits:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Core team can test without worrying about examples
- SDK users have clean examples to learn from
- Cleaner project root with less confusion

All sites tested and building successfully on macOS ARM64.
