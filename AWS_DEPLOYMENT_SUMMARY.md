# AWS EC2 Swiftlets Deployment Summary

## Date: July 8, 2025
## Platform: AWS EC2 Ubuntu ARM64 (Linux 6.8.0-1029-aws)

## What We Achieved âœ…

### 1. Successfully Built and Deployed
- **Swiftlets Server**: Compiled and running on AWS EC2
- **Accessible URL**: http://ec2-3-92-76-113.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/
- **Working Pages**:
  - `/` - Homepage (index)
  - `/about` - About page
  - `/README-JA` - Japanese documentation
  - `/docs/index` - Documentation index
  - `/showcase/basic-elements-simple` - Simplified basic HTML elements demo
  - `/showcase/text-formatting-simple` - Simplified text formatting demo

### 2. Identified Issues and Solutions

#### Problem: Swift Compiler Timeouts
- **Root Cause**: Complex HTML DSL with deep nesting causes Swift type checker to hang
- **Affected Files**: 21 out of 27 files in the showcase site
- **Solution Applied**: Created simplified versions without complex shared components

#### Build Script Issues
- Default 30s timeout too short for complex files
- Build script appears to hang after processing files on EC2
- Manual compilation works fine

### 3. Improvements Made
- Updated `build-site` script with 60s default timeout
- Added EC2-specific documentation in help text
- Created simplified showcase examples that compile successfully
- Documented the entire process

## What We Tried ðŸ”§

### 1. Build Attempts
- Initial build with default settings: 3 files built
- Extended timeout to 120s: No improvement for complex files
- Parallel builds (-j 4): Not recommended for EC2 memory constraints
- Force rebuild: Helped identify hanging issues

### 2. Refactoring Approaches
- Extracted preview closures to separate functions
- Removed complex shared components
- Created simplified versions from scratch
- Used basic HTML elements without heavy abstractions

### 3. Debugging Steps
- Verbose build output to identify problematic files
- Manual compilation of individual files
- Process monitoring to detect hanging compilers
- File-by-file analysis of complexity

## Files Created During Troubleshooting

### Test/Simplified Files (Keep)
- `src/showcase/basic-elements-simple.swift` âœ…
- `src/showcase/text-formatting-simple.swift` âœ…
- `src/showcase/test-simple.swift` âœ…
- `test-build.sh` (for manual builds)

### Temporary/Broken Files (Remove)
- `src/showcase/index-simple.swift` (syntax errors)
- `src/about.swift.skip` (renamed file)

### Documentation (Keep)
- `AWS_EC2_BUILD_GUIDE.md` âœ…
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` (this file) âœ…

## Lessons Learned ðŸ“š

1. **Swift Compiler Limitations**: 
   - Complex type inference in result builders has practical limits
   - Files with 100+ lines of nested HTML DSL often fail
   - Shared components add to compilation complexity

2. **EC2 Considerations**:
   - Memory constraints require sequential builds (-j 1)
   - Longer timeouts needed (60s minimum)
   - Build script may have compatibility issues

3. **Successful Patterns**:
   - Simple, flat HTML structures compile reliably
   - Avoid deep nesting and complex closures
   - Direct HTML element usage over abstractions

## Recommendations Going Forward

1. **For Development**:
   - Continue using simplified patterns for new pages
   - Test compilation locally before EC2 deployment
   - Consider pre-compiling binaries for distribution

2. **For the Project**:
   - Report Swift compiler issues upstream
   - Consider build system improvements
   - Document complexity limits in main docs

3. **For Production**:
   - Current setup is functional for basic sites
   - Complex showcase demos need architectural changes
   - Server performance is good once files are built

## Current Status: âœ… Operational

The Swiftlets server is successfully running on AWS EC2 with 6 working pages. While not all showcase examples build due to Swift compiler limitations, the core functionality is proven and the deployment is successful.
