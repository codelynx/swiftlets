# Project: Swiftlets

## Overview
This project is inspired by Paul Hudson's Ignite static site generator. While Ignite only renders static websites, this project aims to use similar result builder patterns to develop a dynamic web server and CGI-like Swift components that work on both macOS and Linux (Ubuntu).

## Architecture
Swiftlets uses a unique modular architecture where:
- The web server acts as a router to standalone executable modules ("swiftlets")
- Each route maps to an independent executable (e.g., `/getting-started` â†’ `bin/getting-started/index`)
- Executables are built on-demand from Swift source files
- Each swiftlet is isolated and can be updated without restarting the server
- Future support for multiple languages beyond Swift

### Platform Support
- **macOS**: x86_64 (Intel) and arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: x86_64 and arm64 (Ubuntu and other distributions)

Core development builds executables into platform-specific paths:
- `bin/macos/x86_64/` for macOS Intel
- `bin/macos/arm64/` for macOS Apple Silicon  
- `bin/linux/x86_64/` for Linux x64
- `bin/linux/arm64/` for Linux ARM

Third-party SDKs provide pre-built executables in `sdk/{platform}/{architecture}/` format. During deployment, only the target platform binaries are used.

See `/docs/swiftlet-architecture.md` for detailed architecture documentation.

## Current Status

See `TODO.md` for the current task list and priorities.

## Development Workflow

- Always work on the `develop` branch
- Merge to `main` manually when ready
- Don't merge automatically

## Goals
- Create a SwiftUI-like declarative syntax for building dynamic web applications
- Support server-side rendering with real-time data
- Implement CGI-like components for handling HTTP requests/responses
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS and Linux/Ubuntu)
- Use Swift result builders similar to Ignite's architecture
- Enable hot-reload development with automatic compilation
- Support process pooling for performance
- Allow mixing of different programming languages

## Latest Development
- **Unified Swiftlets Framework**: Consolidated SwiftletsCore and SwiftletsHTML into a single `Swiftlets` framework
- Implemented comprehensive HTML DSL with Ignite-inspired syntax
- **60+ HTML elements** covering all common HTML5 tags:
  - Document structure: Html, Head, Body, Title, Meta, Script, Style, Link
  - Text elements: Headings (H1-H6), Paragraph, Text, Span
  - Lists: UL, OL, LI, DL, DT, DD
  - Tables: Table, THead, TBody, TFoot, TR, TH, TD, Caption
  - Forms: Form, Input (all types), TextArea, Select, Option, Button, Label, FieldSet
  - Semantic: Header, Footer, Nav, Main, Article, Section, Aside, Figure
  - Media: Img, Picture, Video, Audio, IFrame
  - Inline: Strong, Em, Code, Pre, BlockQuote, Small, Mark
  - And many more...
- **Layout Components** with SwiftUI-like syntax:
  - HStack/VStack with alignment and spacing
  - ZStack for layered layouts
  - Grid with flexible column/row definitions
  - Container with responsive breakpoints
  - Spacer for flexible spacing
- **Helpers** for dynamic content:
  - ForEach with index support
  - If for conditional rendering
  - Fragment/Group for multiple elements
- **Modifiers** system: classes, styles, padding, margin, colors, width, height, etc.
- **Type-safe** HTML generation with proper escaping
- Result builder (@HTMLBuilder) for composable UI
- Request/Response now support JSON encoding/decoding
- Server updated to parse JSON responses from swiftlets
- Working showcase at `/layout` demonstrating all components
- **Single import**: Just `import Swiftlets` for all functionality
