# Swift Cross-Compilation POC Results

## ‚úÖ Successful Approach

**Docker with ARM64 platform** works perfectly:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -w /app \
    --platform linux/arm64 \
    swift:6.0.2 \
    swiftc hello.swift -o hello-static -static-executable
```

### Results:
- Built static Linux ARM64 binary on macOS
- Binary runs on EC2 without Swift runtime
- File size: 9.2MB (static binary includes all dependencies)
- No cross-compilation SDK needed

## ‚ùå Failed Approaches

### 1. Swift SDK Cross-Compilation
Both 6.0.2 and 6.1.2 SDKs fail with:
```
error: unableToFind(tool: "swift-autolink-extract")
```

### 2. Direct Target Flag
```bash
swiftc hello.swift -target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
Fails with same autolink-extract error.

### 3. Legacy Driver Workaround
```bash
swift build -Xswiftc -disallow-use-new-driver
```
Still fails due to SDK issues.

## üìã Deployment Strategy

For EC2 with limited resources:

1. **Build locally using Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src --platform linux/arm64 \
     swift:6.0.2 swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-executable
   ```

2. **Deploy only binaries** to EC2 (no Swift runtime needed)

3. **Benefits**:
   - No building on EC2
   - No Swift installation required on EC2
   - Static binaries are self-contained
   - Works reliably with Swift 6.0.2

## üîç Key Findings

1. **True cross-compilation** (Mac ‚Üí Linux) is broken in Swift 6.1.2
2. **Docker emulation** works as a reliable alternative
3. **Static linking** eliminates runtime dependencies
4. **Swift 6.0.2** is more stable for this workflow than 6.1.2

## üöÄ Next Steps

Apply this approach to Swiftlets:
1. Modify build scripts to use Docker + static linking
2. Create deployment pipeline for static binaries
3. No need to downgrade EC2 Swift version
4. EC2 only needs to run binaries, not build them
