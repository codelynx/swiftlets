# Musl Cross-Compilation Investigation Summary

## Key Findings

### ‚ùå Native Cross-Compilation with Musl SDK Fails

**Issues discovered:**
1. **Missing tools**: `swift-autolink-extract` is not included in the SDK
2. **Missing linker files**: `/usr/lib/swift_static/linux-static/static-executable-args.lnk`
3. **Missing runtime**: `swiftrt.o` not found in the SDK
4. **Linker errors**: Invalid linker name 'lld' for cross-compilation

### üì¶ SDK Structure
The musl SDKs (both 6.0.2 and 6.1.2) are configured correctly:
```json
{
  "swiftCompiler": {
    "extraCLIOptions": [
      "-static-executable",
      "-static-stdlib"
    ]
  }
}
```

But they lack the actual toolchain binaries needed for compilation.

### ‚úÖ What Works

**Docker with ARM64 platform emulation:**
```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -w /app \
    --platform linux/arm64 \
    swift:6.0.2 \
    swiftc hello.swift -o hello -static-executable
```

This produces a 9.2MB static binary that runs on EC2 without Swift runtime.

### üîç Technical Details

1. **Compilation succeeds**: Can compile Swift to object files (.o)
2. **Linking fails**: Cannot link due to missing tools and libraries
3. **swift-autolink-extract**: In Docker, it's a symlink to swift-frontend
4. **Static linking**: Requires additional linker configuration files not in SDK

## Conclusion

**Musl-based cross-compilation is not currently supported** in the Swift SDK distribution for macOS. The SDKs are incomplete and missing critical components.

## Recommended Solution

Use Docker with ARM64 emulation for building static binaries:

```bash
# For Swiftlets
docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    -w /workspace \
    --platform linux/arm64 \
    swift:6.0.2 \
    swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-executable
```

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Works reliably
- ‚úÖ Produces static binaries (no runtime needed)
- ‚úÖ Solves EC2 resource constraints
- ‚úÖ Available now (no waiting for SDK fixes)
