# Swift 6.1.2 Alignment Status

## Current State
✅ **Mac**: Swift 6.1.2  
✅ **EC2**: Swift 6.1.2  
✅ **SDK**: Swift 6.1.2 SDK installed  
❌ **Cross-compilation**: SDK has issues  

## What We Accomplished
1. Successfully upgraded EC2 from Swift 6.0.2 to 6.1.2
2. Downloaded and installed official Swift 6.1.2 static Linux SDK (287MB)
3. Removed old 6.0.2 SDK to avoid conflicts
4. Both development (Mac) and production (EC2) now use Swift 6.1.2

## Cross-Compilation Issues
The Swift 6.1.2 static Linux SDK has problems:
- Error: "compiled module was created by a different version of the compiler"
- Missing tool: "swift-autolink-extract"
- SDK's precompiled modules may be incompatible

## Working Solution
**Build directly on EC2** - This works perfectly:
- EC2 has Swift 6.1.2 installed
- No version mismatches
- Full toolchain available
- Successfully deployed swiftlets-site

## Deployment Command
```bash
./deploy/deploy-swiftlets-site.sh
```

This script:
1. Packages source code
2. Uploads to EC2
3. Builds with Swift 6.1.2 on EC2
4. Runs as systemd service

## Future Options
1. Wait for updated Swift 6.1.2 SDK with fixes
2. Use Docker with Swift 6.1.2 for local testing
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline that builds on Linux runners
4. Use Swift's upcoming improved cross-compilation support

## Summary
While cross-compilation isn't working with the current SDK, we've successfully achieved:
- ✅ Matching Swift 6.1.2 versions everywhere
- ✅ Working deployment pipeline
- ✅ Site running on EC2: http://<YOUR-EC2-IP>:8080/
