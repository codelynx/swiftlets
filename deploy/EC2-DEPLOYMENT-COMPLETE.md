# EC2 Deployment Complete

## Production Site
ðŸš€ **Live**: http://<YOUR-EC2-IP>:8080/

## Summary
Successfully deployed Swiftlets to AWS EC2 ARM64 after extensive cross-compilation research.

### What Works
- âœ… 22/27 pages successfully compiled and deployed
- âœ… Docker builds with Swift 6.0.2 for Linux ARM64
- âœ… Nginx reverse proxy on port 8080
- âœ… Full dynamic Swift web application

### Key Learnings
1. **Cross-compilation issues**: Swift 6.1.2 SDK missing tools
2. **Solution**: Docker with `--platform linux/arm64`
3. **Build approach**: Direct compilation bypassing build-site quirks
4. **Deployment**: Pre-built binaries with runtime libraries

### Main Scripts
- `deploy-swiftlets-site.sh` - Main deployment script
- `docker-build-deploy/direct-docker-build.sh` - Build Linux executables

### Architecture
- Instance: t4g.small (2GB RAM, ARM64)
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Swift: 6.0.2 (build) / 6.1.2 (runtime)
- Web: Nginx â†’ Swiftlets server
