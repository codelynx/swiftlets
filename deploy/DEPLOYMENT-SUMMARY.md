# Swiftlets EC2 Deployment Summary

## Successfully Deployed!

Your Swiftlets documentation site is now running on EC2:
- **URL**: http://<YOUR-EC2-IP>:8080/
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 on EC2 t4g.small
- **Swift Version**: 6.1.2 (matching your local Mac version)

## Deployment Method

We deployed using the **build-on-EC2** approach:
1. Package source code locally
2. Upload to EC2
3. Build and run on EC2 using systemd service

## Key Files Created

1. **`/deploy/deploy-swiftlets-site.sh`**
   - Main deployment script
   - Packages source, uploads to EC2, builds remotely
   - Sets up systemd service for automatic restart

2. **Systemd Service on EC2**
   - Service name: `swiftlets-site`
   - Auto-starts on boot
   - Automatically restarts if crashes

## Container Approach Status

The container-based cross-compilation approach encountered challenges:
- Swift SDK version mismatch (6.0.2 SDK vs 6.1.2 compiler)
- No readily available 6.1.2 Linux SDK
- Apple's Container Plugin still requires matching SDK versions

## Future Improvements

1. **Container Deployment**: When matching SDKs become available
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployments on git push
3. **Load Balancer**: Add HTTPS support with AWS ALB
4. **Multiple Instances**: Scale horizontally with container orchestration

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Deploy updates
./deploy/deploy-swiftlets-site.sh

# Check service status
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR-KEY-NAME>.pem ubuntu@<YOUR-EC2-IP> 'sudo systemctl status swiftlets-site'

# View logs
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR-KEY-NAME>.pem ubuntu@<YOUR-EC2-IP> 'sudo journalctl -u swiftlets-site -f'

# Restart service
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<YOUR-KEY-NAME>.pem ubuntu@<YOUR-EC2-IP> 'sudo systemctl restart swiftlets-site'
```

## Notes

- EC2 instance has limited disk space (90% used)
- Consider cleanup or larger instance for production
- The deployment builds all dependencies on EC2 (takes ~5 minutes)
- Pre-compiled deployment would be faster with matching SDKs
